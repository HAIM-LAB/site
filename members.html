              I am an Artificial intelligence (AI) researcher, Assistant Professor of
              Computer Science at the University of New Orleans (UNO), USA, and
              Director of the (Human, Hybrid AI, and Machines (HAIM)) Lab at UNO.
              My research interest lies at the intersection of connectionist and
              logicist Al, with a focus on hybrid (reasoning and data-driven),
              knowledge-aware, & explainable AI techniques to solve complex problems
              in everyday life that challenge the boundaries of human and machine
              intelligence. My approach integrates formal logic, automated reasoning,
              machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing tools
              and technologies. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Rensselaer
              Polytechnic Institute, where I was a graduate research assistant in the
              Rensselaer AI & Reasoning (RAIR) Lab. I worked, with my advisor Dr. Selmer
              Bringsjord, in several ONR and AFOSR
              sponsored projects using hybrid Artificial Intelligence
              based techniques.

              My research interests involve exploring AI through the dual
              lenses of neuroscience and physics. More specifically, I am both
              interested in how AI agents can perceive and reason, and how
              machine/deep learning can be used to model physical phenomena. I
              believe the utilization of AI in these two fields can greatly
              deepen our understanding of how the material world and our
              perspective interact. I am also very interested in
              entrepreneurship, i.e. translating our scientific findings to
              make a real-world impact.
